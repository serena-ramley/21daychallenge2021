# 21daypythonchallenge
21-Day Python Data Science Challenge with Lighthouse Labs starting February 17th: https://data-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/

## Day 1 Sign the lease

Below is an example of the f'string format, which allows us to input certain pre-defined variables in a string.

x = 'string'
y = 2021

string_formating = f'This is a {x} format and the year is {y}.' #prints out 'This is a string format and the year is 2021."
To read more on formatting strings in Python read this article.

Challenge: Modify the lease agreement with your signature without changing the original lease variable.

           lease = '''Dear Dot, 
                      This document validates that you are beholden to a monthly payment of rent for this house.
                      Rent is to be paid by the first of every month.
                      Fill in your signature to agree to these terms.  
                       -------------
                       Please Sign Here: 
           '''
